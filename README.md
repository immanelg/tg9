# tg9 

A fast and extensible TUI Telegram Client written in Rust (WIP).

# Installation

You need to get your API ID and API hash before building the application (see [here](https://core.telegram.org/api/obtaining_api_id)).
```sh
export TG9_API_ID=12345
export TG9_API_HASH=12345abcdef
cargo run
```
